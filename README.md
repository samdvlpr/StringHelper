# What is StringHelper
The string helper was born to help me keep a library of useful extensions to strings. I am constantly writing methods across different projects that i again replicate when i move on to the next one so i thought i should create a library. 

## Current Functionality
### Wrap
The wrap method takes a string and wraps into an ienumerable of strings each string is wraped to a certain length and will always go back the the last space to ensure that all words are maintined where possible.

### Repeat
Repeats a specified string for a specified amount of times.

### Random String
Allows you to create a random string with certain formats at a given length.
  
### Trim
Set of extension methods for strings which relate to triming content
#### TrimStartToDifference
Retrieves a string of text with the common text removed from the start until the first difference.
#### TrimEndToDifference
Retrieves a string of text with the common text removed from the end until the first difference.
#### TrimToDifference

### SubString
Set of extension methods for strings which relate to sub stringing content
#### SubStringStartToDifference
Retrieves a string of the common text of two strings from start to end until the first difference.
#### SubStringEndToDifference

### Count
